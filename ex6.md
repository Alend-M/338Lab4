In the lecture recordings, we discussed some of the main differences
between arrays (or lists in python) and Linked Lists.

1. Compare advantages and disadvantages of arrays vs linked list
(complexity of task completion)

Arrays:
Advantages 
- O(1) time complexity in terms of accessing elements because they are indexed.
(Random access)
Disadvantages
- 

Linked-lists:
Advantages,
Disadvantages
- O(n) complexity to transverse, so slower than arrays


2. For arrays, we are interested in implementing a replace function
that acts as a deletion followed by insertion. How can this function
be implemented to minimize the impact of each of the standalone
tasks?

3. Assuming you are tasked to implement a doubly linked list with a
sort function, given the list of sort functions below, state the
feasibility of using each one of them and elaborate why is it
possible or not to use them. 
    1. Insertion sort
    2. Merge sort

4. Also show the expected complexity for each and how it differs from
applying it to a regular array
